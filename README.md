# req-login
REQRES login and validation form

this respository was created using a template I have of a created React native app with only React navigation installed.
the whole validation form and login reqres api calls were created from scratch.

to run the project, please: 
1. clone the repo to your local machine
2. run npm install
3. run -> expo start  (if an access warning is shown, just run -> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass <- it is a security warning
4. from opened web browser select open with emulator or scan barcode if expo is installed on your device.

to run jest test, just run -> npm test

* this is an interview exercise and can not be use for other purposes
